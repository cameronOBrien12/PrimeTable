# PrimeTable
Prime Table task for FindMyPast Application

Cameron O'Brien - Dundee University 

How to Run:

Go to Git: https://github.com/cameronOBrien12/PrimeTable
Download Zip of Repository
Unzip downloaded folder
Open directory "PrimeTable-master" then "PrimeTable(FindMyPast)"
Open file "PrimeTable(FindMyPast)" in Visual Studio
Visual Studio: In Explorer tab open "Program.cs" to see source code
Press "Start" to run program

NOTE: Program works for large inputs, although formatting messes up once it hits screen length.

I'm pleased with the logic behind the program. It all runs smoothly and in a short time. 
If I was to spend more time on this project I would create a GUI and add in much more input validation/security to the program.

NOTE: I have realised I have not used a traditional prime number generator for the table, I have added one in after to show that I know how to do it.

Thanks for considering my application.

Cameron.
